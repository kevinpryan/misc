Here I am checking the proportion of genes in the LM22 signature matrix are included from the Twist Exome panel.
LM22 signature matrix was downloaded from the [CIBERSORT website](https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/download.php).

Here are the outputs of `count_overlap_lm22_twist_panel.py`:

```
517
number of genes in lm22: 547
number of genes not in lm22: 30
percentage of lm22 genes in twist exome kit: 94.51553930530164
genes missing: ['ATHL1', 'CLCA3P', 'CXorf57', 'EMR1', 'EMR2', 'EMR3', 'FAIM3', 'FAM212B', 'FAM65B', 'FLJ13197', 'GPR97', 'GSTT1', 'HIST1H2AE', 'HIST1H2BG', 'HMGB3P30', 'IGLL3P', 'KIAA0226L', 'KIAA0754', 'KRT18P50', 'LILRA3', 'LINC00597', 'LINC00921', 'LOC100130100', 'LOC126987', 'LRMP', 'MARCH3', 'RPL3P7', 'SEPT8', 'TARDBPP1', 'ZNF204P']
```

According to the [CIBERSORT website tutorial](https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/tutorial.php):
```
CIBERSORTx performs a feature selection and therefore typically does not use all genes in the signature matrix. It is generally ok if some genes are missing from the userâ€™s mixture file. If less than 50% of signature matrix genes overlap, CIBERSORTx will issue a warning.
```
